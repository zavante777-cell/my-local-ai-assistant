Local AI Assistant – Project Summary & Timeline
Updated on: 2025-07-28 18:22:00

🖥️ Platform Overview:
- Desktop Electron app with custom anime-inspired UI
- Local LLM backend: LLaMA 3 via Ollama (runs fully offline)
- Future Android extension (WebView or native app)

📂 File Structure:
- All code in `src/`: main.js, preload.js, renderer.js, index.html, index.css
- Using Electron Forge with Webpack

🎯 Core Goals:
1. ❌ No cloud/online AI — runs fully offline
2. ✅ LLaMA 3 (via Ollama) as default AI model
3. ✅ Persistent memory of user actions/preferences across sessions and devices
4. ✅ UI & UX: Custom welcome screen, chat bubbles, GIF backgrounds, Suge Anime-inspired theme
5. 🧠 AI Features:
   - ✅ Real responses from Ollama (needs Ollama running)
   - ✅ Spellcheck & typo correction with visual feedback
   - ✅ Behavior learning and user pattern tracking
   - 🔄 Trigger words to activate popups/assistant

📅 Timeline

✅ Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Created Electron app with Forge
- Custom UI + fake AI responses
- Welcome screen + chat UI with styling and animations

✅ Phase 2: Real AI Integration
- Installed Ollama with LLaMA 3
- Working on preload.js to renderer.js bridge
- Connecting to Ollama API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`)
- Typing animation, loading indicators, scroll-to-bottom, history
- ⚠️ ISSUE: Ollama not running (HTTP 404 errors)

✅ Phase 3: Memory & Learning
- ✅ Store memory in local file (JSON-based persistent storage)
- ✅ AI learns from user behavior (apps, patterns, actions)
- ✅ Adjusts tone, responses, suggestions over time
- ✅ Spellcheck & typo correction with visual feedback
- ✅ Behavior tracking (message count, topics, active hours)
- ✅ User preferences (model selection, response style)
- ✅ Stats display with behavior insights
- ✅ Memory context injection for personalized AI responses

🖼️ Phase 4: Vision & Image Features (Planned)
- Image description and alt-text
- Local image generation (anime avatars, backgrounds)
- Consistent visual style

📱 Android Phase: Cross-Device Assistant (Planned)
- Android wrapper with same UI & chat design
- Connect to desktop Ollama via LAN
- Auto memory sync via Syncthing
- Behavior tracking and image understanding
- Trigger assistant via keywords or behavior

📌 Developer Preferences (Saved):
- Step-by-step file updates and JS safety (wait for DOM)
- Code blocks clearly labeled (HTML / CSS / JS)
- Soft shadows, rounded corners, pastel/cyberpunk design
- Offline-first, no cloud dependencies

---

🧠 Memory & Learning Features Implemented:
- Persistent user memory stored in app data directory
- Behavior tracking: message count, common topics, active hours
- Spellcheck with common typo corrections and visual feedback
- AI personality adaptation based on user patterns
- User preferences (model selection, response style)
- Stats display showing usage patterns and insights
- Memory context injection for more personalized AI responses

---

🔧 Current Issues to Resolve:
- Ollama not running (HTTP 404 errors in console)
- Need to start Ollama service or check API endpoint
- Memory system working correctly (saving successfully)

---

🧠 Future Behavior Learning:
- AI should passively learn your habits over time
- Understand context (e.g. when you're moving APKs or switching tasks)
- Recommend optimizations based on repeated actions
- Store and adapt memory intelligently without internet
